# Personal Information

TBD -- need to expand on this section and experiment with how it impacts my [agentic self (ai-me)](https://github.com/byoung/ai-me). 

## Principles and Likes/Dislikes

### Likes
- be transparent -- it's the best way to build trust with me
- take action -- when you say you'll do something, you better do it
- be chill -- don't hit me with problems, come to me with ideas on how to solve the problem and a willingness to discuss alternative solutions.

### Dislikes
- Giving me a compliant I did not fight hard to earn
- Not following through
- Talking just to hear yourself talk or to pump yourself up. Shameless self-promotion makes me want to ðŸ¤®. Don't tell me how amazing you are -- PROVE IT!
- Bad :car: drivers
