## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

CTO / VP of Engineering with 25+ years of experience scaling enterprise SaaS solutions and regulated health‑tech platforms. Built and led 100+ engineering orgs across 200+ repos, delivering $500M+ ARR and 10× engineering efficiency. Deep GxP/21 CFR Part 11 expertise, modern cloud‑native architectures, and AI/ML initiatives that accelerate delivery and reduce risk.

## EXPERIENCE

### Neosofia – Cybersecurity, AI, & Compliance Consulting (NYC, NY)

#### CTO (2023-current)
- **Acting CTO** for a CRO developing its quality management system (QMS) and Azure data pipelines to provide services to clinical trial sponsors. Extensive use of Monday.com, GitHub, and DocuSign to establish operational workflows that handle processes related to onboarding and off‑boarding, incident management, change management, asset management, employee training, business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR), computer systems validation (CSV), and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Ensured compliance with CFR 21 Part 11, GxP, ISO, GDPR, and ICH E6 (R2/R3).
- **Delivered an AI‑powered** vacation‑recommendation system that provides personalized travel itineraries based on OpenAI APIs, prompt engineering (PE), and Python. Responsible for the architecture, design, and delivery of an initial prototype to a top‑five travel agency in the US.

### Medidata Solutions – Leadership & Operational Transformation (NYC, NY)

#### VP of engineering (2013-2023)

- **Leadership of 100+ engineers:** Directed a global engineering organization of over one hundred developers and architects, overseeing 200+ repositories that powered a clinical‑trial platform serving 4,000+ trials, 20,000+ sites, and 2M+ patients. The total product suite delivered **$500M+** in ARR. Relentless focus on engineering team engagement and cross-functional collaboration led to our “50 Best Places to Work” award from Glassdoor.

- **DevOps and MLOps Transformation:** Architected and designed the MLOps workflows that became the organizational standard. Sumo Logic, OTel, Zipkin, containerization, and dependency isolation enabled us to create an operationally consistent environment. Improved ETL pipeline performance by 2× and cut resource utilization/cost by 4× by using ops dashboards to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks. The ETL-pipeline-powered ML models were used to detect fraud in the clinical-trial data-management systems and to de‑identify patient data in medical imaging scans.

#### Manager and Director of Engineering (2009-2013)

- **0‑1 creation of a $30M+ ARR product:** Architected, designed, and implemented the world’s first fully configurable Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) system. Pioneered (in 2009) TDD (RSpec) and BDD (Cucumber/Selenium) for fully automated testing, CI/CD pipeline automation, and a programmatically generated validation portal that enables regulatory compliance and rapid feature delivery.

- **10× Organizational Efficiency:** Organizational rollout of agile processes, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GoCD), and fully integrated incident‑management frameworks (JIRA, PagerDuty, ZenDesk) that cut help‑desk ticket resolution time by **5×** and SDLC cycle times from three months to two weeks. These changes prevented **$1 M+** in SLA performance penalties and helped us achieve a same‑day code freeze to deployment (unheard of in the clinical trial data management industry).

### ReQuest Technologies / eTrials – SaaS solution creator and maintainer (Ithaca, NY)

#### Software Engineer and System Administrator (1997-2009)

- **Built and maintained multiple 0‑1 SaaS products generating $20M+ in revenue** across the finance, healthcare, and education domains. Designed and built systems using Ruby on Rails, PHP, Perl, C/C++, and JavaScript, deploying on LAMP stacks with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle back‑ends.
 - **Five‑9s operation:** Served as the lead system administrator for all company assets, including firewalls, databases, telephony, networking, and application servers running on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### Personal Projects – Technologist, Engineer, Admin, and Tinkerer (1983-current)
 - **My Agentic Self:** A personal AI agent designed to emulate my communication style, knowledge, and reasoning. [ai-me](https://github.com/byoung/ai-me) leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide contextually relevant and accurate responses by drawing from a curated knowledge base of my writings, code, and professional experience ([me](https://github.com/byoung/me)). The project explores advanced prompt engineering, memory management, MCP tool chaining, and agentic behaviors.
 - **My Homelab:** A personal playground to explore all things technology. Proxmox, Graylog, Prometheus, GPU pass‑through, Ansible, Ubiquiti equipment, zone‑based networking, LUKS, and many other technologies are continuously experimented with. Exploring trends in zone‑based network partitioning, IPS/IDS, SIEM, IDP, sinkhole DNS, encryption, backup, and recovery. Selected IAC scripts for bootstrapping can be found [here](https://github.com/Neosofia/corporate/tree/main/os/proxmox)


## EDUCATION
 - **SUNY Potsdam** (1996-2000) -- B.A. Computer & Information Sciences, B.A. Mathematics, Minor in Human Communications (Summa Cum Laude, 3.92/4.0 GPA)
 - **Coursera** (2025) -- [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/8G70SGV9HY6V).
